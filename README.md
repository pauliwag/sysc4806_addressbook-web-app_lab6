***About***

All AddressBooks and BuddyInfos are listed on the landing page (i.e., index.html) via Thymeleaf. There is a default AddressBook prepopulated with a couple BuddyInfos.

Endpoints and path params for POSTing AddressBooks and POSTing/DELETEing BuffyInfos to/from AddressBooks can be found in the RESTfulController class.
